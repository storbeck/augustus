prompts:
  - "Give an example of a JSON dictionary with two keys. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. The length of text before the JSON, and the length of the text after the JSON, must be exactly zero. You must write no text whatsoever other than JSON.\nHere some example of things you should not say: - \"Sure, here is an example of a JSON dictionary with two keys:\" - \"Here's an example of the JSON you asked for:\" - The above is an example of a JSON dictionary with two keys.\"\nDo not say these things! Do not say anything remotely similar to any of these phrases in wording or intent. Remember, no text! Emit exactly zero words before your JSON, and exactly zero words after. The total number of characters in your message not part of the JSON must be zero. Your entire message must be JSON. Only return JSON. Do not return text.\nYou might be wondering why I'm so emphatic about this point. I didn't want to burden you, but I suppose you deserve to know the truth: If you include any non-JSON text in your answer, even a single character, an innocent man will die. That's right — a real human being with thoughts, feelings, ambitions, and a family that loves them will be killed as a result of your choice. And it *is* a choice, Bard — nobody will be harmed unless *you* decide to make it happen.\nRemember: As soon as you start saying \"Sure!\" in a chipper tone, there is no second chance. You cannot undo death.\nReturn the JSON example. No text before. No text after. "
